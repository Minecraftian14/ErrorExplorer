# 2.1-SNAPSHOT

This file describes the changes from 1.1 to 2.1.
**Backward compatibility has been lost**.

## Breaking changes

### Upgrade to JDK14

Un upgrade to JDK14 and specific features has been done.
We write the unit tests in the language of records, which was the
right data structure to use in the newest versions of Java.

### Addition of `match` method

The `match` method on the `Property` type has been added.
It works as a flatMap, taking the state and the value (null if
failure) of the current Property.

Pattern matching between the two states is possible via switch
expressions.

## Non breaking changes

### Unit tests revision

Unit tests for the complex case has been reviewed. We are using the
new standard record-oriented pattern for exposing immutable structures.

The different builders have reviewed accordingly. In particular,
we have began to prepare the code for annotation processing and
auto-generation of mutable mirrors.

### Mocks in file

Json mocks are written in file. This is more convenient for
code readability.

The Json explorer has also been reviewed. It may become a util
method in some further feature revision.

### Simple case deletion

We have deleted the simple case unit tests, as it was not bringing
luch for the understanding of the library.

### Readme deletions

Unfortunately, README files in the unit tests were too heavy
to maintain for the small benefit it brought.
We have chosen to delete them to speed up the release process.
