# 2.2-SNAPSHOT

This file describes the changes from 2.1 to 2.2.
**Backward compatibility has been lost**.

## Breaking changes

### Remove `isFailure` method

It is not possible to directly ask about failure state through the
`isFailure` method of a property.

We encourage using `match` together with a switch on the state.

### Thread safety lost

We abandon thread-safety and we turn the internal state of a property
to something mutable.

This was because of a practical observation: properties will not be
shared accross threads, nor even different classes. Rather, they mainly
will be bounded to one method call.

As such, we forgive about thread-safety and immutability,
and we have turned the internal state to somthing mutable.

## Non breaking changes

Minor changes have been brought to the code, without altering
its usage nor its feature.
